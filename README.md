# Human_Life_Expectancy_Prediction
In this project, we successfully used linear regression to predict life expectancy based on various predictor variables. Our analysis showed that dataset were significant predictors of life expectancy. This project demonstrates the use of linear regression and provides insights into In conclusion, linear regression can be used to predict life expectancy based on various factors and variables. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, a linear regression model can provide estimates for life expectancy.
However, it is important to note that linear regression models have limitations and assumptions. Life expectancy is a complex outcome that is influenced by numerous factors, including socio-economic conditions, healthcare accessibility, lifestyle choices, genetics, and environmental factors. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome, which may not always hold true for life expectancy.
Therefore, while linear regression can provide a useful estimate for life expectancy, it should be used with caution and in conjunction with other statistical and predictive techniques. It is also crucial to consider the limitations and uncertainties associated with the data used for training the model, as well as the potential for changes in societal and environmental factors that can impact life expectancy.
In summary, linear regression can serve as a starting point for predicting life expectancy, but it should be supplemented with additional analysis and consideration of other relevant factors to improve accuracy and reliabilit
which factors are most strongly associated with life expectancy.
